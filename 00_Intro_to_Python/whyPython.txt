Why Python?

- Portable: Programs written in Python run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Readable: Clear, easy-to-read syntax (PEP 8 style).
- Productive: Easy to learn and fast for prototyping.
- Batteries included: Large standard library for many common tasks.
- Multi-use: Web apps, automation, scripting, data science, machine learning, AI.
- Ecosystem: Huge package index (PyPI) with libraries for almost anything.
- Tooling: Virtual environments (venv), pip, formatters and linters (black, flake8).
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.
- Typing & tooling: Optional type hints and static checkers (mypy).
- Concurrency: asyncio and multiple concurrency models.
- Interoperability: Easy to extend with C/C++ for performance-critical code.
- Community & jobs: Large community, many learning resources and job opportunities.
- Open source and cross-platform.

When not ideal:
- Not the best choice for low-level, real-time, or some high-performance embedded/mobile apps without native extensions.
