PEP 8

PEP 8 is Python’s official style guide: a set of conventions for writing readable, consistent Python code. It’s not enforced by the language but widely adopted across projects and teams.

Why follow PEP 8:

Improves readability and maintainability.
Makes collaboration easier.
Enables consistent tooling (formatters, linters).
Key points (concise):

Indentation: 4 spaces, never tabs.
Line length: 79 chars (docstrings/comments) / 88 commonly used for code.
Naming: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants.
Imports: grouped & ordered — standard library, third-party, local; each group separated by a blank line.
Whitespace: avoid extraneous spaces around (), [], {}, and before commas/colons; add spaces around binary operators.
Blank lines: top-level functions/classes separated by two blank lines; methods inside classes by one blank line.
Docstrings/comments: use clear docstrings (PEP 257) and keep comments meaningful.
Avoid wildcard imports (from module import *).
Prefer explicit over implicit; prefer readability.
