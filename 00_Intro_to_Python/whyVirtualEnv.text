Virtual Environments in Python
A virtual environment is an isolated Python workspace that lets you manage dependencies for different projects separately.

Key Uses:
Dependency Isolation: Each project has its own set of packages and versions, preventing conflicts.
Version Management: Run different Python versions or package versions across multiple projects.
Clean Global Install: Keeps your system Python clean; all project packages stay local.
Reproducibility: Easy to share requirements.txt so others can recreate the exact environment.
Testing: Test code against different dependency versions without affecting other projects.

Benefits:
Avoid "works on my machine" issues
Easier project collaboration
Simple cleanup (delete the folder to remove everything)
Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)


# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv 
So People use make .venv (. is used here to hide this folder)

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install numpy pandas

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
